build: javac AES.java
run: java AES 1/2

to run my program, i take a mode parameter, 1 stands for ECB encry, 2 stands for CBC
encry, so run java AES 1 or java AES 2

a trick, you can run this: java -ea AES 1 < input.txt | diff - output.txt
when you put your solution in output.txt, the above command can compare my result with yours.
